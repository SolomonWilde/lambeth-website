    At the moment, there are hundreds of people stuck at home without a suitable
    device to access the internet 

    to communicate with loved ones, access educational resources and essential online services, or even to 

    get some basic entertainment. It's our aim to collect your unwanted devices and deliver them to people 

    who really need them.

        not only to participate in activities we are offering, but to reach out
        to other organisations who could support them during this difficult
        time, gearing them up with technology can dramatically change their
        lives, allowing them access to vital updates from our COVID-19 Guide on
        IRMO's website to NHS UK and stay connected with friends and family.
