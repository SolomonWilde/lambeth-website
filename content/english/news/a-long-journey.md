As a Palestinian and member of the Labour Party for over 30 years, I find the Labour Party leader Keir Starmer's slavish devotion to Zionism increasingly baffling.

On 29 November Starmer and his deputy leader, Angela Rayner, attended a conference organised by the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM), and Labour Friends of Israel (LFI).

Of all dates in the year, Starmer could not have chosen one more calculated to gratuitously insult the Palestinians. His visit coincided with the UN International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian people, a major event in the Palestinian calendar, held on 29 November each year since 1977.

Its purpose is to remind the world that the question of Palestine remains unresolved. The "inalienable rights of the Palestinian people", defined in the 1975 UN General Assembly Resolution 3376, as self-determination and the right of refugee return, are still unfulfilled.
